    "# DB Starter documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### About\n",
    "This IPython sample notebook is a generator tool for the database folder-structure and input files for the supported quantum-chemistry packages. Note that this DB Starter version will perform a conformer scan.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since writing all structures / inputs at once is not necessarily useful before one knows if any of the properties can be learned efficiently, all generator steps are performed in random subsets of the Database entries. The notebook has one general \"Input Section\" (which has to be run every time to initialize the Generator), as well as three different Parts (A-C) that may be used independently. A guide to which calculation types are available for auto-generation and how you can include new calculation types can be found in the documentation. Also, you can find an explanation on how to correctly set up your required \"CoreStructure.xyz\" file and the Fragment library there.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Please, make sure to carefully read all cell's contents as well as their commentaries, as this will help you properly executing the notebook.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Section\n",
    "A section that defines how the database folder-structure should be set up.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A\n",
    "Part A samples a random part of all available database entries for performing unbiased, randomized training. This way you can stepwise increase the amount of training data. The output of this part is a library file, containing the desired number of samples in a format compatible to everything else that ArchOnML requires.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B\n",
    "Part B sets up the database folder-structure and generates the starting Guess xyz-structures for all subsequent machine-learning tasks of a specific sample, that was obtained within Part A.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part C\n",
    "Part C can be used to set up specific calculation inputs for the external quantum chemistry program packages that are supported by ArchOnML. It reads a user-specified library file to write new input files that can carry out your desired calculation type in a way that can be directly read by ArchOnML's Machine Learning routines."
